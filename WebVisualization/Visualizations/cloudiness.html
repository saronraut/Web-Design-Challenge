    <h1 class="headline"> Comparison: Latitude Vs. Cloudiness</h2>
    <p class="intro_1"> Utlizing the Data collected from multiple cities. We wanted to see how the Humidity would 
        vary based on the Latitdue position of the city. The Range of latitude for over 500 cities are in -60 to 80.
    </p>
    <p class="intro_2"> We were able to generate a plot for all cities in our data. In the plot, It's really hard to 
        find a coorelation between latitude and cloudiness. The plots are sporadic. We could conclude the cities cloudiness
        cannot be determine by just looking at the latitude. Maybe the approach should consider looking at cities based on Enviroment 
        location and terrain.
