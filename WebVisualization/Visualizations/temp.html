    <h1 class="headline"> Comparison: Latitude Vs. Max Temperatures</h2>
    <p class="intro_1"> Utlizing the Data collected from multiple cities. We wanted to see how the Max-Temperature would
        vary based on the Latitdue position of the city. The Range of latitude for over 500 cities are in -60 to 80.
    </p>
    <p class="intro_2"> After using our expert analytical skills and mastery of MatPlotlib, we were able to generate a plot
        for all cities in our data. In the plot, we can notice there is a trend of rising Max Temperature as closer we get to
        the equator. Another thing deduce is that peak point for Max Temperature is not at zero (equator) but is actually in the
        range of (10-20) latitude postioning. This could be due to other factors that could contribute to higher Temperature
        other than the geolocation. Which could've been further investigated.
