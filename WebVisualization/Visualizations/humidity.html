    <h1 class="headline"> Comparison: Latitude Vs. Humidity</h2>
    <p class="intro_1"> Utlizing the Data collected from multiple cities. We wanted to see how the Humidity would 
        vary based on the Latitdue position of the city. The Range of latitude for over 500 cities are in -60 to 80.
    </p>
    <p class="intro_2"> We were able to generate a plot for all cities in our data. In the plot, we don't see a bell-curve like
        we could see in Max-Temperature. It seems the Humidity ranges from 50 to ~100 in most cases. With the exception
        of anamoly which seems to have a humidity rate of 300. This could be due to a code error when we were analyzing the data
        or that there is a place in this world the humidty rate of close to 300%. We did however filter cities from our list that
        had humidity ranging higher than 100%.
