    <h1 class="headline"> Comparison: Latitude Vs. Windspeed</h2>
    <p class="intro_1"> Utlizing the Data collected from multiple cities. We wanted to see how the Windspeed would 
        vary based on the Latitdue position of the city. The Range of latitude for over 500 cities are in -60 to 80.
    </p>
    <p class="intro_2"> We were able to generate a plot for all cities in our data. In the plot, we can see that majority Windspeed
        regardless of latitude postioning is between 0-20. We also see an anomoly where there is a case of windspeed close to ~50 mphs.
        The high speed anamoly seems to be closer to the pole. When near the equator the windspeed tend to be with in the 10 mphs
        range.
