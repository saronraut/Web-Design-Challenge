# Web-Design-Challenge

The excerise invovled us sharing our data we collected on previous assignment. The Task required us to utilize what we know about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we have accomplished. 

What's in the repository:

    - Within the /resources folder: We have cities.csv file which is our data source.

    - DataFrame_to_HTML.ipynb file was used to convert the dataframe into a HTML which would help in creating the Data.html page. 
    - /Visualizations folder is where all the created HTML file exists.

        - Landing_page : Homepage for the Dashboard. Interactive Images with little details on the purpose of the assignment.
        
        - Temp, Humidity,Cloudiness, Comparison,Data,Windspeed pages: all of the pages can be navigated from the homepage and also the interactive Toolbar Buttons Created



Using Github.io we were also able to launch our dashboard page. Link provided Below.
